# Implementing Serverless Microservices Architecture Patterns [Video]
This is the code repository for [Implementing Serverless Microservices Architecture Patterns [Video]](https://www.packtpub.com/application-development/implementing-serverless-microservices-architecture-patterns-video?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781788839570), published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/?utm_source=github). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the video course from start to finish.
## About the Video Course
Video Description
Building a microservices platform using virtual machines or containers, involves a lot of initial and ongoing effort and there is a cost associated with having idle services running, maintenance of the boxes and a configuration complexity involved in scaling up and down.

In this course, We will show you how Serverless computing can be used to implement the majority of the Microservice architecture patterns and when put in a continuous integration & continuous delivery pipeline; can dramatically increase the delivery speed, productivity and flexibility of the development team in your organization, while reducing the overall running, operational and maintenance costs.

We start by introducing the microservice patterns that are typically used with containers, and show you throughout the course how these can efficiently be implemented using serverless computing. This includes the serverless patterns related to non-relational databases, relational databases, event sourcing, command query responsibility segregation (CQRS), messaging, API composition, monitoring, observability, continuous integration and continuous delivery pipelines.

By the end of the course, you’ll be able to build, test, deploy, scale and monitor your microservices with ease using Serverless computing in a continuous delivery pipeline.
